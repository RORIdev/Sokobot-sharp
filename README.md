# Sokobot-sharp
A Discord bot that lets you play Sokoban (reimplemented on c# and using an alpha build of sisbase)

Quick note before contributing

I'm currently using an `alpha` build of [sisbase](https://github.com/siscodeorg/sisbase) since i'll use the `Interaction` API, which is **not** currently merged onto the development branch.

I'm a special snowflake and one of the maintainers of sisbase, please **do not attempt** to use any `alpha` build of sisbase on production.

In order to get the `.nupkg` [Click Here](https://github.com/siscodeorg/sisbase/actions?query=workflow%3Aalpha).
